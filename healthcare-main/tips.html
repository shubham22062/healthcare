                    <h3>Stay Hydrated</h3>
                    <p class="tip1">Staying hydrated is crucial for optimal health, but it's easy to forget to drink enough water throughout the day. 
                        To build a hydration habit, start by drinking a glass of water first thing in the morning and setting reminders to sip regularly. Carry a reusable water bottle with you as a constant reminder. Liven up plain water with slices of fruit, vegetables, or herbs. Pay attention to your urine color and thirst cues, and drink more if you exercise or work in a hot environment.  For an extra hydration boost, incorporate water-rich fruits and vegetables into your diet. Remember, sugary drinks dehydrate you, so choose water instead. There are even apps that can help you track your water intake and stay on top of your hydration goals. By making small changes and incorporating these tips into your routine, you can ensure your body stays happy and healthy. </p>

                    <h3>Maintain a Balanced Diet</h3>
                    <p >Eating a variety of foods from all food groups ensures you get the essential nutrients your body needs to function properly.
                       Achieving a balanced diet is all about variety and moderation.  
                       Imagine your plate divided into sections: fill half with colorful fruits and vegetables, offering a spectrum of vitamins and antioxidants.  
                       Next, dedicate a quarter of your plate to lean protein sources like grilled chicken, fish, beans, or lentils.  
                       The remaining quarter can be filled with whole grains like brown rice, quinoa, or whole-wheat bread, providing essential fiber for digestion.  
                       Don't forget healthy fats! Include a drizzle of olive oil, a handful of nuts, or a slice of avocado for satiety and nutrient absorption. 
                       By incorporating these elements in each meal, you'll create a well-rounded diet that fuels your body and keeps you feeling your best. </p>
